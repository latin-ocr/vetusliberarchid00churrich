has already been mentioned. At Fowllncrc (p. 89) there was
a mrbus bene apparatus de inzoegsinibns fleam-atis and another at
Borough Greou (1553) rlmcecralus eum lapidibus cristalinis. Again
at Gt S. Marsis, Cambridge (p. 33), was missale precismvam, lmpsatum
argsenta comparum-io varen «albo. The brass incense ship in the form
of a dove at Litlington (p. 115) is very unusual and must also be
spccially noted.

In the chapel at March (p. 147) the coat of arnis of the donor,
Robert (le Lisle‚ on the rotunda pia-is, 11111)γ have been painted or
enainelled, or engi-aven, and so may the salutm-io bns—(ti l'irgsim's on

(p. 139) were in needlew0rk3 for they were on vestinents.

It is not necessary to give a full list of the designs in needlcwork,

interesting too is the record at Cottenham of a red domm-ium stained

Chapel at Newton (p. 91) was of silk with the heads of slaves
embroided in silk on it: and at Hauxton, to which Newton is now

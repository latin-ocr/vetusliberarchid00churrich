SYNODALS ETc. JoTTINGs 005

grand total perhaps came to about ΕΠ. The Rural Dean of Camps
was let off his church's contribution and the l’wdel got 12ιΙ. (p. 72):
no doubt the same was the case in the other Ueaneries: and it is
not likely that the Archdeacon and his ollicers let the money pass
without taking their toll.

So it appears as if the Rural Deans collected or helped to collect
the Procurations and Peter's Pence, but the Synodals were brought
by the clergy when they, attended at Cambridge.

It is perhaps not entirely unjust to suppose that part of the
anxiety to secure their attendance was due to this. One Archdeacon
or his Officia} soon after the. compilation of the Inventories (B hand)
went through them and added Rp and . v. to each church, according
as there was a Rector or a Vicar. Also he put S‘) over or near the
occurrence of these names in the text. The word suspensus (cf. the
Constitution on p. 7) naturally suggests itself but it would hardly
occur so universally¹‚ and Ι think nothing more is meant than sum-
monitus or s'zwnmonendns. Not only the Rectors and Vicars were
summoned but also most of the heads of Religi‹j›us houses who
were Impriipriators, from the Prior of the Hospitallers down. They
were represented by Proctors, the Prior of Coventry paid his 33. 4cl.
(p. 6) while the Prioress of Chatteris is noted as not having sent
hers (p. 142). However the Prior of Ely who held more rhurches
than any seems to have. established a right to be exelnpt. The
Chaplains are regularly summoned. But being summoned was not
the sanie as attending. The comlnonest note next to s9 is “ 110 9,'⁷
which by comparison with “ vicarius non compati-[uit] ⁷³ at Cambridge
Holy Trinity (p. 234) or the synonym ‘⁴ non venit ⁷⁷ passim, explains
itself. So ca. 0:19, cap5 (passim) are explained hy “ capellanus 11011
co '³ at Longstow (p. 126). Sometimes we have, as at Histon
St Andrew (p. 78), “ea p non 9,’' helped hy “s9 ca9 paroch⁷³' at
Barton (p. 98). That it is indeed a matter of the Synod we see
from “ ca non in sinod⁷ nec rector '' (Carleton p. 54). The result is
seen at Toft (p. 122) “ R. 11011 9. pem-il non venit citetin·,'' or Fen
Ditton (p. 40), “Dominus 1. (16 Ely cum rectore 1“ι 9 2 ca non f).
it[erum] sqs' Better than nothing was “non 9 R'. penei! veniet
vicarius (¹3).‘'' Several entries especially about chaplains are in
F hand, late xiv c.

Occasionally these notes preserve the name of a chaplaim eg.

Canterbury Diocese sede vacante 1292-4 : see Arch. Cant. xxxii.

NOTES ΟΝ THE TEXT

Owing to the various unavoidable causes, which have delayed
the printing of this volume, there is often a discrepancy between
the references to the notes in the text and the notes themselves
(l) Sometimes a reference is given in the text (by a letter of the
alphabet) and, when the page and letter are turned up, no note is
found. This is due to the fact that, when the text was set up, the
Editor still hoped to be able to say something about the person or
thing referred to but was afterwards disappointed. Nevertheless
the “aching void ⁷² is left, in case those into whose hands the
volume falls may in time to come he able to supply some informa-
tion for themselves. (2) Sometimes on the other hand no reference
is given in the text and yet a note will be found on something of
interest, which was discovered or elucidated by further research.
(3) Many of the notes that are given are of a very inconclusive or
meagrc character but, considering the unusually difficult problems
of various kinds that the text presents, ost* seemed worth while to
make suggestions as to their explanation (however scanty or uncer-
tain) which might afterwards be followed up.

In the Preface an attempt has been made properly to acknow-
lcdge the help which has been received from the many friends
and c‹‡›r1·espondents who have been consulted. But it seemed
necessary to precede the notes with these remarks in order to warn
readers from the outset against cxpecting anything like complete
information in them.

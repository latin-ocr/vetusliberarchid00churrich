Norwieh 1528), though he was LL.D. of Cambridge 1534, advocate
1539, Principal of Borden Hall 1531 : see Cooper, Alli.. (saun, 1, 123.

p. 2. (a) Tlnmms Hamowl of Waddon. This is an old county
family. Rye, (wamhs. Fines, p. 122, gives “ Roget· H. of Meldeburne
and Matilda his wife '' in 1:369 (Melbourne being near Whaddon)‚
and “Thomas H. and Matilda his wife. in Berklove and Magna.
AbyngtmN' in 1:397, p. 140, and it may be noted that there were
Hamonds in that 1leighbourhood, viz. at Pampisford, till the end of
the 19th century.

(h) An indic-fian was a period of 15 years instituted as a
means of reckoning time by Constantine the Great, ‚J an. l, 313. See
further below, p. 268.

(c) Bida-ard Kyllgsnyuvrth (see also p. 7((1) below). The
name seems associated 111 the MS. with the year 1455. It was a
prominent Cambridge name, eg. in 144ss (see Cooper, Annale, 1, 197).

(sl) Demonium. Perhaps a reference to some exorcisation
which had recently occurred (lat Kimbolton).

(e) Nic-ledus Γ, mentioned twice here and again three times
on pp. 6 and 7 below, was pope 1447-55. (The date here and
twice there is wroneg given.) His family name was Tonnnaso
Parentucelli of Sal-zena. He was called the Apostle of Learning
and founded the Vatican Library. He first conceived the idea of
enlarging the Vatican Palace and of turning S. Peter's into the
most splendid church of Christendom, though Julius II carried it
out 50 years later.

(f) Lumley, I can throw no light 011 this entry, unless the
reference be to some ancestor of that well-known Lord Lumley
(† 1609), whose library first became part of the Royal Lihrary and
then by the munificence of George 11 was given to the nation: see
Cooper (Ath. Cant„ ΙΙ, 516).

p. 3. (ιι) J[[ayister] le. cholcrell. He is mentioned Rot. Hand,
11, 409. One Agnes M. was outlawed for theft in 1236 (Cooper,
Annals, 1, 61).

(b) Very little elucidation of this very curious (late xv c.)
fragment referring to indulgences has come to 1116. Canon
Chr. words-,worth has been consulted and, though he has as freely
as ever opened his stores of knowledge, and put them at my dis-
posal‚ it is evident that he also is puzzled. Several references to
the Brit. Mus. MS. Harl. 955, dcc„ which he gave me did not yield
the results he thought possible. He cannot at all identify the

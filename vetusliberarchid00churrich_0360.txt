306 EXCURSUS G

I. (16 Ely above, Dominus (16 Moyne at Chesberton (p. 74), Ioh.
Aleyn at Oakingtson (p. 80).

A few of these extra 1101366, mostly pencilled ones, have to do
with the letters of ordination and the suita13ility of particular clerics,
ag, “ca sufficiens⁷' at Fen Ditton (p. 40), “litteras ordinacionis ab
Elyensi citra natale ⁷⁷ ab Babraham (p. 66), “dicit officialem vidisse
litteras suas'’ at Croxton (p. 130) and “ habet (116111 ad querendum
litteras⁷⁷ at VVhaddon (p. 108), but hore another entry is nob clear to
1116, “...bertus ad (116111 sabbati ut sat...‹lt‚'’ cf. Bassingbourn (p. 110)
“ Riobertus (116 sabbati,” East Hatley (p. 104) “ XVillelmus die
sabbati.'' Refbrence has already 116611 made (Introduction, p. xvi)
to the “ Diete 111 visitando ⁷² on p. 80 sqq.

In the Deaneries of Chesterton, Barton, Shangay, &Visbeach and
part of 13611111, where later erasures have not, destroyed it, each
church has a note iiij d. and usually q’t (quit) sometimes “def[icit]''
or “non q't '' as at Triplow and Fowlmere (p. 88). What sees these
were does not appear, perhaps the private perquisito of the collector.

The analogy of the cases here cited will make very nearly al]
these jottings more or less intelligible.

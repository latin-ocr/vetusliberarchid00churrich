268 NoTEs ΟΝ 'rim TEXT (PP. 151-160)

(7) March 27 is the traditional day of the actual Resurrection:
hence the words resurrectio Domini prima against that day. On
May 19 we find ante Pentecosten more oct. Post Pentecosten ia·
lec„ which we may conclude means that if S. Dunstan⁷s day falls be·
fore XVhitsunday it is to be treated more octava (i.e. with :3 lectionsh,
and if after, it is to have 9 lections. (8) 011 Sept. 24 we read hic
¹matcmtur indic-tiones. Indictions (ῐ periods of 15 years) instituted
by Constantine the Great Jan. 1, 313, were of three kinds (a) Greek,
which began Sept. 1, (b) Imperial (or Caesarian) which began on
Sept. 25 and (c) Pontifical, which were reckoned from Jan. lst
or Dec. 2:3th (Hampsom ορ. cit. 11 p. 224). Here therefore it is the
Caesarian Indictions that are indicated. Pontifical l‘ndictions seem
to be referred to on p. 2, etc. above.

VI. It is not necessary to give a list of those days to which ix
or iii lections are assigned. There is considerable variation as to
this in all medieval Kalendars. But there is another liturgica] note
which occurs frequently throughout and which is uneonnnon. Either
before or after the note as to lections, in a good many cases are added

the words ‘⁴ more oct[are] This, one concludes, means that the
festival is to be treated with the same dignity and observances as if
it were an octave. ¹

VII. In the notes that follow reference is often omitted to
names that have no special interest for English readers.

Jan. 13. ὅ. llilary was Bp of Poitiers (1 368). For s. Bemz'gsz'us
see Oct. 1.

dan. 14. Felicis in pincis. Interesting accounts of this saint,
who was a priest of Nola in the 3rd century, will be found both
under his name (in J). ΟΒ. 11 p. 499) and under that of Paulinus of
Nola (lv pp. 236 ff.) [η pincis, which is the form found in medieval
Kalendars, yields no satisfactory sense and is thought to be a corrup-
tion of im pineis (viz. in the pinewoods outside Nola, where the
saint's burial place still exists).

Jan. 15. S. Maurus (1584) was founder and abbat of the first
Benedictine monastery in France at Glanfeuil on the Loire.

Jan. 28. Ay‘ncbis secando. See Dowden, Clearclo 'eam p. 71 for
this unusual way of denoting an octave.

Feb. 3. S. l;la.>·iu.s‚ Bp of Sebaste in Armenia (1316), had a
special cult in England as patron of the Wooleombers.

Feb. 6. S. I'edasc, Bp of Arras (1 540), is less commonly coin-
memorated on this day than S. Arnaud, Bp of Maestricht (1 (346) and

PREFAOE

T 15 at least eight ancl probably more nearly ten years ago
511166 I was first induced—rather against my will—to under-
take the editing 01 this MS. 101· the Society. I felt that it was
too diffienlt and cmnplicated a 111511ν for a parish 111-16511 who had
already a good many 1111616515 and 11111165, to eope with at all
satisfactorily, even though Mr Rogers‘s eareful transcript was
111 my hands and I was then living within easy reaeh of the
University and 115 Library. More than 01166 511166 Ι began to
study the 6011161115 111 the volume more tlummghly, 1 have been
teinpted to repent 01 my 1166151011 and have in fact offered to
resign the attempt—inme especially when in 1910 we removed
into 11115 remote corner 01 Kent. At last, however, the tiinely
intervention 01 1111· 111111115 111 1913 and 1115 111161· to be responsible

efficient (so—operatism. Accordingly 1115 name appears on the
Title-page with mine, seeing that again and again his 11111111υ
has been at work with 1116 011 those portions 10 which 1115
initials are not appendesl. I 110 not claim, therefore, the entire
credit even there 101· what 15 good, though I am bound to bear

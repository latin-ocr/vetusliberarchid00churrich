the number of English names and especially those of female saints
(the three sister queens Sexburga, &Vithburga and Etheldreda,
Radegund and Osith)‚ but neither of these points seems to throw

the publishcd Catalogue of Caius MSS.) has suggested that our
Kalendar may have come from a book once belonging to the Augus-
tinian Priory of Barnwell, because S. Augustine “our father'⁷
(Aug. 28) is in red and has an octavo. He shares his red ink here

Oct. 11, thc feast of “the translacyon of our holy fader Saynt
Augustyne'' (of Hippo), a date which is marked in the Barnwell
book as well as herc, as the Octavc of Aug. 28 also is, and Ebner
(Iter Italicum, p. 1:34) gives “Aug. 2& Augustini ep. (red with
octave)'' from a very interesting MS. (lssth cent.) which belonged

of S. Augustine (H. Β. S. edu, p. xxviii).

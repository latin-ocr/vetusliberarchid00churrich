F. THE ARCHIDIACONAL VISITATION LISTS.

The following is an attempt 10 guther together under different

011111011 books, ornaments, 010. Much light has been thrown 011
1110111 by the valuable study bestowed on them from a paleographical
standpoint by ΜΓ Minus ε the results of his labours are 501 forth in
his own words above on pp. xxix ff. und not only have I availed myself

Cunterbury’s visit to the diocese in 1277 (pp. 18 f.) during the next
year or so throughout the Archdeaeonry (see p. 142 a and Intro-
duction, pp. xiv and xvi). The various additions were made, some
almost immediately afterwards, probably under 1110 same Archdeaeon
(XValpole) and then under his suecessors at their visitations up to the
end of the xivth century3 in particular we can see the results of
Fodringhey's visitation at the beginning of the xivth century from
1115 name and the date being actually given in several cases.

Fodringhey’s visitation a new work was begun on the S. side
of the chureh by Robert Gose, who protested that he refused to be
held responsible (himself or his 110115) for the upkeep of the said

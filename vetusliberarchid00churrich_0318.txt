264 NOTEs os THE 'rEXT (pp, 151—160)

refer to Radulphus le Bret of Dukesworth in 1303 and 1306, and
he may be a son of the man whose obit is here given, and the others
relatives, (b) ‘⁶ William Huntingfield '³ was no doubt a member of
a family of great importance throughout the Eastern counties. Can
he be the VVm de H. who was justice itinerant, sheriff of N orfolk
and Suffolk, mentioned by Matthew Paris, who J'oined the Barons
in support of Magna Carta and who died about 1249 (see Dict. of
AVat. Βῖθυν. s.v.)‘.2 Another Wm de H. was master of the Hospital
of St Thomas de Acon in 1267. The heir (Roger) of a Wm de H.
15 mentioned in 1316 <15'uffolk Archaeols Trans. vol. XI, p. 187)
and another, WVm de H„ knight, held the manor of Bokesworth
111 1376 (Camhs. Fines, p. 129: see also p. 41). Of these three
the last certainly, and the second probably, are too late for the
entry: the first however is possible. (c) ‚John de Eltisle “father
and son’' belonged to another important county family, and the
exact date (1356) being given makes the entry additionally 111-
teresting. -John de E. and Matilda his wife in Newenton
(Ζ Newton) are mentioned in 1272, Cambs. Fines, p. 45 : this might
be the elder of the two Joliiis here mentioned if our former suggestion
is wrong3 the date is apparently too late for the ‘⁴ Matilda ‘¹' whom
we have otherwise cnm-jecturally disposed of. (d) ⁴‘ Rosa Aldreth '²
it 15 diffie-ult to place with any certainty. The surname is a corrup-
tion of ‘⁴ Etlieldreda,” and appears also in the “Aldreth causeway
and bridge over the Ouse by which the Isle of Ely was connected
with the rest of the county between Haddenham and Rampton ''
(C. C. Babington‚ Aac. Canaba, pp. 79 ff). “Geoffrey de Alder-
hethe, chaplain '² before 1279 gave away a messuage in Cambridge
(Stokes‚ quorv Trumpz'uyton Gales, p. S): our entry belongs to a
date 1ΟΟ years later than this3 see also Cambs. Fines, p. 117
(1357).

IV. It seems natural to deal next with the more definitely
historical notes, which one 01· other of the former owners has added
to the Kalendar. Some of these are connected with our national
history and some have a more local bearing, while 0116 15 of a more
general interest altogether: I mean that found affixed to Apr. 16
Isto die erat papa Urbanus xj coronatus etc. an. [mccc]lxxviii 3 this
was Bai-tolomeo Prignano crowned 1378, under whom began the
great WVestern Schism.

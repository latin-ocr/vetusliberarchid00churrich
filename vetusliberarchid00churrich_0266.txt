these chantries is given in each case: for the two latter they are
normal, but at Badburham the scheme has one unusual element.

In all three provision is made for the occurrence of a Saint's
day during the week (viz, first germaium de saneto pro animabus·
predictis), But the curious point at Badburham is that on Tuesday
the missa de sancta Eustaehio is to be used (MNO crucifixum (1.0.
before the Rood). This Saint used to be connnemorated on Nor. 2,
until the commamomtio (mimarum (All 801113> day) instituted among
the Cluniae lnonks in the xith cent. became more and more general
throughout the VVest and at last ousted S. Eustaoe, and his feast
was transferred to Sept. 20. The missa on Tuesdays at Great
Shelford is for S. Stephen, because that was the dedication of the
chapel, but at Badburham it was the Lady chapel that was to be
used. S. Eustace was specially associated with hunting, and John
de Scalariis may 011 that score have had a pencliant for him. But,
in some medieval Kalendars both S. Eustace and commemoratio
animm-mn are assigned to Nox: 2, and I have wondered whether
that fact in any way accounts for the selection here. There is
however always a vast and apparently capric-icus variety in these
chantry schemes: see Chr. XVordsworth's App. 111 to Tracts of
Clamant Maydeston (H. Β. S„ vol. Vll), pp. 159 ff.

(b) John (Ie *S'calariis Aaron of York brought an action
· against hini (stokes, Studies iu Anylo-Jemish msc„ p. 157): see
Hoc. Hand. ΙΙ, 382, 509, etc. One of that name occurs in Rye,
Cambs Fines, with Alice his wife at Cheveley in 1267s8, and again
(without wife) at Dullingham in 1271]ss (pp. 42 and 45). If this is
the founder of the B. chantry in memory of his wife Sibilla, he had
apparently married again by 1267, and the foundation probably
dates before that year.

(e) Johamzem David, evidently the capellanus of the chantry,
but thesurname is a strange one for a cleric at that date.

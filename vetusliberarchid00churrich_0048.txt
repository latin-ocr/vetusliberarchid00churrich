xxxii INTRODUCTION

Intelligibly to present such things in print it seemed well
to bring out the original Inventory as clearly as possible and it
accordingly appears on the left-hand page and, in order to pre-
vent its text being interrupted, corrections and additions have
been relegated to the right-hand page.

The original Inventor-ies are not however all in the same
hand: for one thing Chapelries were not included in the first
scheme and their Inventories are nearly all in a later hand, still
the first text of them has been kept on the left-hand page.
Further more than one hand (see below under A) was used for
the Inventories of churches, and finally the original text of
certain Inventories (see below under A) has been entirely
erased and a new text written over it. This has been likewise
kept on the left-hand page as being for our purposes the earliest
text.

Nor are the tot-als of Synodals, Procurations and Peter's pence
due to the first hand, but they are not on a par with the additions
to the Inventories and in their first form they have been kept on
the left-hand page. With these are connected the jottings as
to dues and summonses found above each Inventory. All these
are B except a few marked F.

The corrections and especially the additions are themselves
composite as the facsimile shews. The beginning of a supple—
mentary addition is marked by the sign ffl—but this does not of
itself denote a change of hand, as after an interval a man
might sometimes add further particulars to what he had written
before.

The hands used, whether in the original Inventories or in
the additions, are worthy of study for the light they throw upon
the activities of successive Archdeacons, the gradual enrichment
of the churches and the persons of the benefactors named: one
or two of them recur in gatherings Ii—IV, XIV, XV and this is
some help in dating them, but unfortunately it has been found
impossible to make a straightforward list of all the hands
employed and refer each addition or correction to a particular
hand. Different hands often resemble each other to our eyes,
whereas the same hand takes on varied aspects due to various
conditions of pen, ink, writing-surface and space, or even to the

BooKS. MISCELLANEA 301

Church the only organ is, by a curione coincidence, mentioned, but
alas even there the once excollent instrument (omani optimi) seems
to have fallen into disrepair or become worn out: for a later hand
expunged the enti-y. (ly-flaua, in ecclesiastica] pai-lance, was the
technical name for the part music to which Alleluia& and Sequences
wore often set and sung, and that is probably the meaning of the
cantus ornauit-us· above: see Frere, Wimlwsm· Proper (ll RS),
pp. xxxvii ff.

7. Clzeets atre several times noted 3 eg. at Swaffham S. Μαι-γε
(p. 49), at Orwell (l). 103) and at Newton (in the Isle) (p. 121); the
first of these uias for keeping the service books in, the last two for
vestlnents: in three other cases the purpffle is not specified, viz.
at Great &Vilbrahani (p. 51), at. Crauden (p. 105) and at Tadlow
(p. 107). The xiiith century chest at Long Stanton S. Michael is
not noticed.

S. Reliqvie (relies) are mentioned at Linton (p. 63); and part
of Ds John Sleford⁷s gift to Balsham (p. 61) was a small gilt oross in
([ηα insistitur] j pecia columpne in qna (T'lcristus [flayellatus est] :
the restoration of this most interesting entry is very prohable.

9. Campam mammes are found in two ohurcheS, viz. at Stow
<culn Quy) (p. 47) and at Little &Vilbrahani (p. 49) 2 they are
probably the sanie as the tintimeabtdco mentioned three times, vix.
at S. Peter's outside the gate, Ozunhridge (p. 39), at S. Vigor's,
Fulbourn (p. 42) and at Iokleton (p. 71) ; these were specially
ordered in the Stabula ›S'ynoclalia (p. 12), together with a light, for
which the lmetaerna (or lucerna), so often mentioned also, would be
required.

10. At Chatteris (p. 142) the 92·ch (gf Corpus Cla-isti (see above,
p, 300) gave a banner pulverizatum cnm leonibux ‹mm-i. This is the
only mention of a inedieval gild in the MS.

ll. A pathetic note is struck at Eversden Magna (p. 122):
vicaria est-ilis quia abhas (de §CO Albano) subtrahit portionem debitam
vicario. This is in the earliest hand: let us hope that my Lord Abbat
inended his way83 a later hand (0¹) reeords that the then vicar was
in a position to give a frontal (without binding h'is successors how-
ever to do the like).

Another entry may be conveniently referred to here, though it is
of a different kind. On p. 29 it is stated at S. Clement's, Cambridge:

cristallo arqenc' le'yata, cum &voilia-0 ezr-(lenter) et data ymo· ll'efsitewaldnm

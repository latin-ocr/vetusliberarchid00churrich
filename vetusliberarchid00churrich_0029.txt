Its existence makes it unnecessary t'or ine to do more than draw on it for a
very brief outline of the subject by way of introduction and correlate the
different documents in our text with the various sides of an Archdeacon's

Decretal. Grau. IX, 1, tit. xxiii and a MS. entitled Pastoralc tle Officio Archi-
diuconi Visituntffl (Arsennl, 352, in 8¹¹), of which Grca op. (1, p. 219 sqq.
makes 11111011 use. In England the Decretals are supplemented by the Con-
stitutions of Otho De Archidiaconis (ap. Lyndwood, 1679, Suppl.p. 52), cf. those
of Othobonus (ib. passim, esp. pp. 114, 115) and of Langton Ut Archidiaconi
(Lyndwood, Provinciale, p. 49), Peckhaui, Eisdem etiam temporibus (ib. p. 51)
and Reynolds, Sint ecclesiarum rectores and Archi‹li‹1cm1e (pp. 52, 53) and by the
decisions of the Councils of Oxford and London, the Synods of chhrpm and
Worcester and the Statutes of various Bishops⁷ such as inf. p. 9, 1110141 of thc

111 the case, of the first four tho period of the 011199 is short ; with

24 years respectively.

W⁷ickham Chureh (pp. 57 1.). Tf tho text is rightly deciphered‚
another Chancellor may be a donor to Foxton Chul-ch (p. 93), bnt
even so, it is quite uncertain whether 119 was 01111119911011 of the
University.

Dr Thomas de Castro Bel-nardi, Master of Peterhouse (1400-
1418), was a donor to Lolworth (p. 139).

Two donors to Cambridge Churches arc described as ‘¹ Robert

(sce 1). 33, eto).

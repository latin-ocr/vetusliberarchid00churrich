216 NoTEs oN THE TExT

(p. 9 contd.) of Norwich (1244-1257). Wilkins Charisia, 1, 732f.‚ gives these
as added to by 1116 successor, Simon de Watton (1257-1267), but
the coincidences are confined to the first half of the Norwich
Statutes. The order of the provisions is not always the same but
otherwise the Norwich Statutes account for a considerable proportion
of our MS. down to nearly the end of its p. 35. One or two things
are in other statutas, eg. Langton's, Otho's, William de Kirkham's,
bp of Durham (1240-1260), and &Valter de Cantelulie's, bp of
Worcester (1237-1266). As to the Councils mentioned on p. 37 of
MS. there seems no 611611 identity of language as suggests actual
copying of their canons, though of course the things forbidden are
often the same¹.

I give a summary of contents, indicating the possible sources or
parallels in the doculnents Ι have mentioned.

(1) Parish priests are to know and teach (a) the decahjgue,
(b) the seven deadly sins, (c) the seven sacraments, (cl) the contents
of the creeds, the greater and the less, i.e. the Nicene and the
Apostles⁷z to this the Norwich Statutes (indicated by Ν2 henceforth)
add Quicumque vult.

This section is found in N (Wilkins, 1, 731).

(2) The Archdeacon or his official is to see that each priest

knows these tl‘lings before admitting him to the cure of sonls.

(3) Priests are to move people to contrition when hearing 6011-
fessions and to be careful in granting absolution.

(4) No one from another diocese (alienus) is to be admitted
without full inquiries as to his orders and character. (2), (3), (4)
are not in N.

(5) Priests are to give frequent instructions about Baptism.

This canon is nearly as found in Otho, p. 11. (Not in N.)

(6) S. Etheldred is to be daily commemorated througlwut the
diocese. (Not 111 N.)

(7) The people are to be taught to bow reverently to the Host
at Mass and in the street, and the Priest himself is in all respects
to treat the Host with reverence‚ using a light and bell, etc.
(Differently expressed in N.)

(8) The holy Oils and the Host are to be kept under lock and

1 Also it is not quite clear which Council of Lyons (or London) is referred
to: that of the Lateran is of course the Fourth. There were two Councils of
Lyons, 1245 and 1274.

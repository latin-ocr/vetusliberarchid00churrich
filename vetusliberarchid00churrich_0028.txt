number of Archdeacmiries with fixed 11001111111165. Within the
limite of his district the Archdeacon was the representative of
the Bishop in matters administrative and judicial, and, though
11111161115 lay from his court to the Bishop’s and the Bishop
always had the right of reserving for 1115 own ‹lecision whatever
question 116 thought fit, still the Archdeacim was accessible and
limited, whereas there was no telling when or where the Bishop
with his many interests could be got to decide any particular
matter. Accffldingly in practice the jurisdiction of the Arch-
‹leacon became more and more 11111611611116111, 111111 116 began to
think of himself less and 1655 115 the deputy of the Bishop.
Finally in the xiiith century the Archdeacon was 100011015611 by
1011006111 HI as a dudem ordincto-ius, a separate authority.

This involved a deliinitation of 1115 jurisdiction ι615 against
the Bishop’s, and this was very difficult in that it was originally
a mere einanation of the Bishop's and, as tcmching 56001111
matters, identical in range with it. Indeed the vagueness of
Archidiaconal functions 15 almost pmverbial. Another conse-
quence of this 111116116111161106 was that after true mediaeval
fashion the Arehdeacon, having· established his right to do
certain work and receive certain sees for it, soon delegated the
work to 1115 “ Official '⁷ whom he paid with a poi-tion of the fees.

But this way danger lay, for the Bishop, ‹ilissatisfied with
the confiict between 1115 authority and that of 1115 former deputy,
appointed an Official or Vicar-General of 1115 own and 50 to
speak cut the ground from under the Archdeacon, 115 01106 the
superior court put 115611Ι within their 1611011, 5011015 preferred to
have 16000156 to it and save themselves the risk of an appeal.
On the 0001111601, the authority of the Archdeacon speedily
‹leelined and the Council of Trent took away nearly all that
was left, so that there 15 now nothing remaining but an honorific
title. In this country the. Archdeacons lost most of their 1011101111
work, hut they still 110111 0001135 111111 (10111161 charges, and remain
115 inspectors of 1116111111165 and 11001150ΐῖ the Church, and valuable
assistants of the Bishop in various insormal ways1.

HANDs IN MS. xxxiii

caprice of the scribe. Still, except where a correction merely
substitutes one number for another—such cases have been left
undefined-an entry ean almost always be assigned to a group
of hands and these groups can be arranged in a chronological
sequence and even eonjecturally dated. The letters A to F
accordingly denote six such groups within each of which
particular hands shewing recognisable charaeteristies are distin-
guished by numerical indices: less individua] hands bear only
the letter of their group.

 

1, c. 1278. A is assigned to the original hands which wrote Inventories of
churches and brief entries as to the quasi-parochial chapels of
Ν611Ἐο11, Coton and the puzzling Steeple Morden‚ whereas
other chapels are always in later hands. The Inventories
of Witcham and Doddington on p. 125 were also an after-
thought supplied by ΒΞ. Half the Deanery of Chesterton
from p. 8Ο ΕΟ mid-way on p. 84, 1.6. Ε116 original entries of
Chesterton‚ Milton, Waterbeach, Landlwach, Cottenham,
Impington, Histon and Girton were for 501116 reason erased.
They were copied out afresh by Bl, but he got three churches
instead of two on to p. 80,' and so when he came ΕΟ p. 84
he found a blank and went on with Oakington until he
noticed that this inventory was below on the page: he
then cancelled his own entry. He must have been working
from a rough copy. The earliest date mentioned 15 1278
(Wilburton, p. 123). As this follows just after the Arch-
bishop's visitation in 1277 (pp. 184, 183, 47, inf. p. 18) 1Ε
looks as if the book was cornpiled in consequence of the
Archbishop's injunctions, and as if we might refer all the
A hands ΕΟ about this date. A¹ precedes 1284· as it gives
Cambridge St Peter extra portam (St Mary the Less) as
appropriated to St John's Hospital and not ΕΟ Peterhouse.

AO is the hand in which p. 46 is written. It 15 11οΕ the sanie as
any other A, but the writing is too much rubbed to let us
566 whether it is the same as some B hand. I would
suggest that it 15 a fragment of a rough 01· trial copy
discarded because it (lid not leave enough rooni for additions,
this page surviving because it belonged ΕΟ a quire which
contained other related matter.

EXTRA NOTES ABOVE INVENTORIES.

The Notice of each church gives its yearly value', and the amount
paid for Synodals, Procurati011s and Petor’s Pence. These amounts
are sunnned up :tt 1119 end of each Deaner5‚ and 11 grand total 101·
the Synodals and Procurations appears 111 the end of the Inventories
on p. 148.

The Synodal Fee is always 2⁵¹. id. paid in two instahnents when

this reason his state was limited, and he was not allowed to come
too often lest 119 Ι911011111 become 11 1111111911. By the 1111191· part of the
xiiith century the payment in kind had been commutes] for 11 money

Dean was let off the amount paid by his own church. There is a

up the Deaneries I make the totals of the Synodals AEl 4. 23. 4cl. and
the Procurations 2⁴38. 103. Osl. Perhaps VVisbeach, together with
the slight alterations that the corrections indicate, may account for
the discrepancy in 1119 Synodals. The imperfect list of Synodals on
p. 28 gives the half-yearly paymentsz the discrepancies are serious,
but little is to be made 01 it, itis so much corrected and then rubbed.
The amount& for Peter& Pence vary roughly according to the assess-
ment of each church. The total is not given for the Ely Deanery,
1101· is there a grand total, but the other Deaneries make up 4815. 93.
In the imperfect list on p. 28 the totale of these agree fairly well
with those in the Inventories 3 we further have the separate amounts
for Chatteris, the Whittleseys and Doddington aud for Ely Deanery

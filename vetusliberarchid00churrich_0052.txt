T rumpingtcm. The latter gives 1344 as a terminus post
quem. It does not give the appropriation of Whaddon in
1351 01· Litlington in 1358.

Ε2 0 01111οι15 back-shwping hand records the appropriation of
Litlington to Clare Hall, 01111 0 fair number of additions.

the Official on pp. 185—191 (inf. pp. 175, 178).
F, e. 1365 It is very hard to draw the line between E and F.
—1390. F¹ (000150), F² (light), Fa (cursive), probably represent more
than three hands.

ΡΞ 5001115 10 have copied the Constitution on p. 128, perhaps the
memorandum dated 1386 011 p. 127.

F⁴ 011 p. 64 certainly wrote the 01111105 011 pp. 127, 128 dated
1383 and 1389, 11111 I 0111 1101 quite sure of 1110 other 00505
where I have marked this hand.

1380 01111 Pampisford dated 1387 (p. 79).

The last year 10 which entries go 15 suggested by the
names of Thomas ‹le Castro Bernardi at Lolworth 1377-1381,
J. Upton 01 Boxworth, c. 1389, William de Fulbourn, d. 1392,
at Fulbourn„ John de Sleford, d. 1401, at Balshffln, 01111 by the
fact that the appr‹:›priati‹;›n of Cherry Hinton to Peterhouse in
1395 15 1101 recorded. It is true that appropriations of
VVhaddon and Caxton in 1351 01111 of Steeple Morden in 1381
are passed over, but 1390 5001115 about 1110 lower limit.

The uncertainty of the arguments upon which most of the
above datings are based cannot be disguised: except in the case
of the dated entries, the name of a donor gives us 01 11051 0
terminus ante quem a given hand had not ceased 10 be used, and
arguments esc silentio with reg-ard to appropriations are clearly
invalid: still the attempt 10 11010 the hands seemed worth
making, and 15 much helped by careful observation of the
order in which entries follow each other. It is not unlikely
that after R. de F‹1›‹li·inghey's evidently energetic term of office
there was 501110 slackness, that the D hands are the result of
the stimulus applied by Archbishop Walter Reynold's Con-
stitution of 1322, 01111 1110 Ε 11011115 due 10 John de. Stratford's
in 1342.

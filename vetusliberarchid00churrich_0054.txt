leaving his books to his College. Special thanks are due to that
learned Society for putting the MS. at the disposal of the
CAS. during many years.

Later in the 17th century, Τ. Layer, a most industrious
antiquary, transcribed the greater part of the MS: of the longer
items he has omitted only the Archbishop's Ifflnerary, the
Kalendar‚ the specimen letters and the long [samolum Archiepi·
scopi. His transcript is now in the Bodleian, MS. Rawlinson
B. 278 : it was kindly sent to the. University Library in case it
might supply the text of passages cut off or faded in the original:
unfortunately these mutilations are older than Layer⁷s time and ·
in no case does 116 furnish any fresh matter.

Blomefield used the MS. in 1723, and it has never been lost
sight of since. The latest to extract profit from it was the
Rev. C. H. Evelyn White, who read a paper upon it to the
O.A.S. and published a valuable article in the East Anylian,
xl, p. 305. Some fifty years ago Mr Herbert Hailstone copied
out the 111ve11t.0ries, but I do not know what became of his
transcript. Ever since his time the idea of publishing the MS.
has been entertained : now it has been carried out, but has had
to be finished under most unfavourable circumstances. Feci¹

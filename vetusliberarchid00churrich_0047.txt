PRESENTATmN or TEx'r xxxi

are confined to the beginnings of sentences, and to proper
names. Abbreviations have been nearly always expanded with-
out remark, but where there is a probable expansion which is
not absolutely certain, it has been enclosed in square brackets ;
where it is impossible to be fairly sure what form was in the
scribe’s mind the word hasbeen left curtailed and an apostrophe
takes the place of the abbreviation mark. Certain jottings
found above each Inventory are so excessively abbreviated that
it has seemed safer not to expand them but to give them as
nearly as possible as they stand. They deal with summonses
servesl on the clergy of each church, the response thereto and
the sees due from them (see Excursus G, p. 304).

The punctuation has been modernized except in the Inven-
tories: in these the full stop universal in the MS. has been
retained save where items are closely connected in grammar
(eg. by et '’) or sense.

All through the book the character of the hand employed
in each entry or document has been indicated as nearly as
possible, but in the case of the Kalendar and the Inventories of
Church Ornaments, both of which received additions of very
various dates, this was not quite a simple matter.

The Kalendar has hardly anything in common with the rest
of the book: it is hoped that the notes on p. 151 will sufficiently
explain the typographical representation of its peculiarities of
script: the additions to it being small require no special appar-
atus to indicate them.

The Inventories on the other hand demand peculiar treat—
ment because of the way in which the additions were made and
the interest that they present.

The facsimile shews two pages, 106, 107. The latter is a
normal page on which the first hand wrote the Inventories of
two churches leaving a certain amount of room for additions,
but as these churches were rather rich the latter have filled up
all the margins as well as the space left for them. Page 106 13
peculiar in that it has the inventory of one church and of a
chapel, the latter written in a later hand over an erasure. Here
again the additions have taken up all the room available without
much regard to order.

Tho value (11Π tho Archflcaconry may 111· put round about
5:100 a year, tho estimato sot upon it by the Bishop when 111·
had to make a return of prcferments held by alionsg but this
was 111 1346 before 1111· 00881011 of Haddtham'. On p. 202 th(-v
items Haddenliam, VVilburton and proventus ‘incerti amount to
«8121 6⁸. Sd.. but they are only taken from the Trucut‘io Papae
Nicholai (1291), pp. 265, 267, made for the purpose of assessing
the Tenths. In the King's Books it is valuesl at ,5597 58. Qssdf’
William of VVykeham valued his very rich Arclujleaconry ‘of
Lincoln at 1:350.

Where a Cathcdral was scrvcd by Secular Canons the Arch-
‹leacon was usually partly provided for by being made a member
of the Chapter3 sometimes hc was excuscd some share of
resislenco in consideration ‹Jf 1118 (1111108. This arrangement was
impossible in a monastic foundation like Ely and instead 111·
held, probably from the institution of his (lignity, the impro-
priation of Wilburton in th‹= 18111 which hasl ber-n a possession
‹Jf the llloliastery, and there he had 1118 country house. By thc
Laudum Arcltaepiscopi? hc receivml in compensation for sur-
rendering 111111811111111111 over certain places the much richer
rectory of Ha‹il‹lenham and these two churches emistituted 1111·
main part of his income.

grant is unusual even for those of later date (36 years, 140 days);
and the summa inclulyencicmmm (10640371 years, 5497 1ents, 80
days) points to even more extravagant lengths still. “The refer-
ence to 811118110ιῖ)Γ 111 the opening sentence,'''' 110 says, ‘⁶ perplexes me.
In my puhlished list of 160 Pardons or Indulgences connected with
Salishury or other places in Wiltss. circ. 1165-1536, they are usually
of modest pretensions, 13 or 30 01· 40 01· 100 days relaxation of
penance enjoined-..both 111 the Missa] and in the Breviary. It is
the Sarum Primer or Home B. V. Mariae where the rubrics speak of
lavish grants of pardon‚ as in some editions the title-page declares.
Here are instances 2

(1) ‘These iij prayers (Dae Jesn Christe, ἂρ.) 110 written in
the chapel of the holy cross in Rome otherwise called sacullum
sancte crucis septem ronmnorum. Who that (levoutly saith them
shall obtain XC.M. (;1,000,000) years of pardon for deadly sins
granted of our holy father Jhon XXII, pope of Rome (circ. 1316).’
(See Hoskins, Primam, p. 127.)

(2) ‘Sixtus IV (circ. 1480). At the arr> 11011, three times a
day the sum of the indulgence and pardon for every are Man-ia
viij hunchzed (lays and lx totiens quotiens (amount presumably 7740
days)⁷ (ibid. p. 126).

(3) ‘He that devoutly beholdeth these arms of our Lord...
shall have 6000 years of pai-don of S. Peter the first pope of Rome
and of thirty other popes...successors after him; and John XXII

venial sins⁷ (ibid. p. 127).

(4) ‘ Pope Benedict XII (circ. 1335) made this prayer
(qratias ayo) and gave to all that (levoutly sayeth it as many years

(5) ‘ lmage of Pity (circ. 14:57) xxxij RIDCCLV years which
indulgence sixtus IV doubled (z 65,510)‘ (p. 112).

Nevertheless 111 the 15th century the ordinary offer of pardon
was more moderate :

er shall understond that it is granted to all here beying
present at this tynre able to receve pardon viij yere xlj dayes beside
the indulgences of old tyme graunted‚ which is xi yer' 11] score ἁ* xv
dayes. Summa totalis xix yer’ cccxvj dayes ’ (Salisb‘zw'y Ceremonies,

Sec„ p. 41). ι

¹ xc in the text stands apparently for ‘⁶ ten times a hundred,” not for ninety.

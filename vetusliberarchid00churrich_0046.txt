xxx INTRODUCTION

The natural order seems to be pp. 111-412, lsai—183, 47—48,
49—50‚ 43-44, 51-52, 53-54, zie—46, and so they have
been printed, but as 41—-42 and 49—50 cannot be parts of the
same shevt, being turned in opposite ways, there must have
been loss of leaves 01· cancelling.

The Ordinacio Oapelle de ›S'chetsbrtln pp. 179—181, was on
0116 sheet, inserted in gathering XIV, and of course pp. 184—183
are foreign to xv. So pp. 217—220 were one sheet inserted
in XVII.

The present state of the book suggests that the various
independent documents which make up two thirds of it 111616
01166 kept together unbound and suffered from being rubbed as
certain pages witness. All blank spaces were gradually filled
up with various minor memoranda. Some Archdeacon or his
Official remedied this state of things by binding them all up
with about 70 additional 1⁷›ages(gatherings 1, >il—XIII, XIV part,
XVII, XVIII) to provide space for further memoranda and copies
of docuinents concerning his office. These extra pages, many
of which are still blank, are distinguishable by their poor
quality and careless shaping. As the earliest dated entry on
such a page is of the year 1429 it was no doubt in the time of
Archdeacon Robert de Wetheringsett that the work was done,
very likely by John Wygenhale who became Officia] in that
year. It was probably then that the edges of the old leaves
were cut down and some of the Inventories mutilated. The
book was rebound in the lssth century by which time the
leaves were displaced as the numbering shews. When it was
rebound in the l9th century single leaves were joined to make
sheets in 511611 a way that we can no longer be sure which
belonged to which.

In the text printed below the most probable original order
has been followed, as it is also 111016 convenient for the subject
matter. ,

The original spelling has been kept throughout the text
save that j has been banished except in numerals and the con-
venient distinction between vowel 11 and consonant v has been
introduced: the inconsistent 1156 of capitals has been systema-
tized and 111 the Inventories and in pieces of continuous text they

PREFACE v ii

HE long and difficult task of making the original transcript
was executed by A. Rogcrs, M.A., of tho University
Library. How difficult it was may be jndged from the facsimile.
It was admirably accomplished within the limits prescribed by
the Sooiety. When the transcript had been made, the Uni-
versity Librarian was good enough to give up some of his
scanty leisure to comparing it with the MS. and determining
which was the original hand in the Inventories. This business
of transcription and revision required a considerable time. In
1913, when Ι took office as President of the GAS„ matters were
at a standstill, as there was 110 0110 10 see the Text through'the
Press, for this work ‹Jbvimisly required ready access to the MS.
and Dr Feltoe had now 1011 Duxford for Ripple near Dover.
Such is my excuse 101· intel-vening. On fiimiliarizing myself
with the MS. Ι felt that if the edition was to be satisfactory
something more should be done tmvards distinguishing the
different hands employed in the MS. This took several months,
and the transcript was not ready to send to the 111-111101· before
the summer of 1914. In my revision Ι always had Mr R‹j›gers
at hand, and I do not think Ι altered anything without his
approval. The outbreak of the war naturally made it difficult
for the Press to get 011 with the setting up, but since ‘June 1915,
when I undertook war work in London² the delays 1111110 been
due. to me, it being a physical impossibility for me 10 make
much progress in the few hours of free time left me each week,
and the fortnight’s leave in the year. On this ground I claim
the reader’s pardon for many shortcomings in the parts of
the work 101· which I am responsible, the Introductory Sketch,
the Description of the MS„ the Text and Excursus G. Naturally
many suggestions with regard to the text have been contributed
by Dr Feltoe, and I have had the privilege of reading his Notes
and Excursuses, but it is perhaps satisfactory that each should
be responsible for his own portion. I have found many other
helpers, but my special thanks are due to Dr H. P. Stokes for
several points of local history, to Dr F. J. Allen for his patient
skill in making the Facsimile and 10 Dominus Archidz‘acomcs
qui 1111110 est for his Imprimatur.

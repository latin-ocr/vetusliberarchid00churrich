xxxiv INTRODUC'rioN

Α] 15 the main original hand (see facsimile).

Α2 15 confined to the enti-y Barton (p. 95). It puts the numbers
after the objects catalogued: this and its untidiness lead
to confusion.

A=³ wrote pp. 117—122 part of the Deaneriesof Bourn and Ely:
in this too the numbers sometimes come second.

A4, confined to p. 123, Wilburton and Chatteris‚ mentions the
1278 visitation.

A5‚ confined to p. 124, VVhittlesey St Mary, alone mentions the
fines imposed for non-amendment of defects.

A hands never give donors' names: they take the presence of
the ornaments for granted.

Β,ο, 1275 Β denotes the first layer of additions between the compiling of Ι

—1303. the lists 9. 1278 and the appearance of Ralph de Fodring-

hey⁷s dated entries in 1304.

Β] most often occurs in vasicra, eg. pp. 80-84, 106 (v. plate),
123 (partly), 124, it is s‹g›metimes hard to be sure of its
identity in small entries 011 a fresh surlace, but it seems
quite clear for Kneesworth chapel, p. 100. Β] also began
the list of chapelries 011 p. 52.

Β2 15 most characteristic. It always registers defects except on
p. 123 and 011 p. 125, where it is the original hand for
Witcham. and its chapelry March.

3³ may be more than 0119 hand, it generally presents the first
additions made to a list, but follows BI and B'-'. It is hardly
represented on the facsimile.

B⁴, a rather ornamental hand of rare occurrence, Cambridge
St Andrew p. 58, Triplow p. 89, Whaddon p. 102.

Τ119 hands which add up the Synodalia, etc. at the end
of each Deanery seem to be the same as some varieties
of Β3, eg. cf. pp. 82 and 87.

Τ11059 which make the summaries 011 pp. 54 (almost
rubbed out) and 126 599111 like those of the Archbishop's
letter, p. 184 (1277), and the list of Advocates on p. 43
(1289)

To the B class belong the Inventories of Howes and
Benwick chapels on pp. 45, 46, and other chapels in the
teiit: Linton (3³), Kneesworth (B1), Royston, Redreth‚

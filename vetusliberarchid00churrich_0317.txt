to the Augustinian Cluui-h at ‚Ierusalem and is now in Rome, and
this also has “ot-t. ll transl. Augustini ep. y¹: cf. ibid„ p. 161.
There is theiwffore some support for the Provost's suggestion, which
may be said at present to hold tlw field.

HI. On the other hand ’Μι- Evelyn white (Eas-t Aaylian, Notes
ancl Qewrz'es (new series), vol. XI, p. 2105) maintains that it is from a
Book of Hom-s. Several ot' the additions and annotabimus at least
indii-ate thatin course of time it came to be used eventually by a
layman at his clevetiens—perhaps by more than 0116 111 suceessi0n;
but we are hardly justified in dedueing that it was ever actually
bound up with a Book of Hours.

What, the additions and annotations of this kind are must now
be mentioned :—(l) Jan. 24 ‘⁶ Dispensatus '’ (late 141511 cent.) and 111
margin “dies lune’² (11111 cent.): (2) Feb. 6 “natus erat Iohannes'’
(late l4th cent.): (3) Apr. -1 (in margin) “ Rosa Aldreth decessit ''
(late 14111 cent.) ι (4) Apr. δ’ Obitus Matildis (lssth cent.) : (5)
Apr. 13 Obitus Radulphi Brito (l3th cent.) : (6) -July 5 (in margin)
“natus sum-s-⁷’ (late lssth eent.¹): (7) Aug, 4 (in margin) “more-
batur filius meus '¹ (late 14111 eent.) : (δ) Aug. 16 “Obitus Iohannis
filii magistri Iohannis de Eltisle anno domini 111⁰ cccm‘* lvi⁰²² (l4th
cent.) : (9) Sept. 27 “ Obitum willelmi Huntynfeld⁷' (in red chartei·
hand of 13th cent).

Putting these nine entries in their chronological order under
the guidance of the one precise date (1:356) and the evidence of the
bandwritings, we may hazard the following account of them :—-
⁵⁶ Ralph Brito ⁷⁷ (5) and (3 his wife) “ Matilda ³² (4) died about 1250,
as did also “William Huntingtield ⁷' (0), a person of some import-
anee in his day judging by the style of this entry. The first owner
of the Kalendar, who ea: hypotlmsc' aequired it from the Augustinians
111 the earlier part of the Mth century, “was born '⁷ (6) in 1260:
he was possibly related to Ralph Brito and BIatilda, and may be the
elder ‘⁵ -J obn de Eltisle ’³ (ὅ) whose son “John ”died in 1356. A later
owner than 116 was “betrothed'‘ (l) about 13⁸0: his son “John’'
(2), the offspring of the marriage, was “l)()1·ll⁷' scon after and “died '³
(Τ) before 1400, as also did “ Rost- Aldretli '' (3).

With regard to these names themselves a few further guesses 01·
suggestions may be made. (a) As to ‘⁴ Ralph Brito ⁷²: the surname
in that form occurs several times in Cambs. Fines (viZ. pp. 3, 10, ll,
13 and 16), and as “le Bret⁷⁷ (pp. 4, 53, 69, ’73) ; of these the last two

³ The note ‘⁴ anno gracie 1n‘'[000] sexagesimo ’' may belong to this entry.

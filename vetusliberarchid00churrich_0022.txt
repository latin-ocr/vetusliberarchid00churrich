vi PREFACE

unknown by face. If I actually mention only 11 few of thern, those
whose names I oniit will> I hope, not take it aniiss nor think
1110 ungrateful. Ι feel bound in the first place to record my
obligations to Mr Alfred Rogers, because he is the oldest of iny
helpers in point of tinie and has always been niost anxious to
do what 110 0011111 for nie. Then there is the Rev. J. H. Crosby
(01 Ely), whose painstaking 105011101105 have been freely at niy
disposal, not only those which he 11115 printed in the De'ocescm
Rettzemlnrwccr, but those also which are still in his private
possession. Occasionally I have mentioned 111111 by name in the
notes as the source 0101111005 information about 501110 particular
person, but his help has been 11111011 111010 frequent than those
instances would iinply——especially in the Inventories. Another
valued assistant has been the Rev. Dr H. P. Stokes (of S. Pauss,
Cambridge), to whose printed and unprinted researches into
University and other lore I have cmistantly referred: he has
never failed 1110, when appealed to. Nor has niy old friend
the Rev. E. Synionds (of ›Selwyn Gardens, Cambridge), who has
perhaps inore reason than anyone else to 1001 thankful that,
when these pages appear, he will 110 longer 110 called on by·
a post-card 110111Ι 1110 to look up 501110 obscure point 01 knotty
problen] in the Library!

Lastly there is the staff of the University Press, who have
not allowed thcir own special war-difficulties to inipair their
efficiency or to niake them less obliging than they were in the
times 01’ peace.

It 15 not necessary to make a list 01 the principa] printed
authorities to which 1 ain indebted. In 1111 cases they have
110011 described fully enough to bc identified where they are
quoted.

The unusual interest and even iinportance of this MS. will
ainply justify this endeavour to put it within 1011011 of the
Menibers of the Society3 and they will, I trust, be lenient to
faults, which cannot greatly 1111111111511 their gain.

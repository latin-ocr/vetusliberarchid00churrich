10. 27. (α) ,S'enteneia yeneralis. Various forms of this excom-
munication were issued. based upon the. Constitution of Stephen
Langton at the Council of Oxford, 1222. The sentence was to be
read to the people as a rule four times a year, here only three times.
It seems generally to have been delivered in an English translation
(see XVordswm‘th, ,S'alssltzzry Proepssims, pp. 44Ηῖ), We have a
reminiscence of this custonn in the “general sentences '’ at the Con]-
inination on Ash WVednesday in our RQP.

p. 29. (ιι) cantaria ἔνι’ Nicholai. , Wni de Lolworth of Cain-
bridge, clerk, fmmded :1 01131111)ν 111 1323 at S. Cleinent's with two
chaplains. who were to celebrate bivine Service (11111)γ at S. Nicholas's
altar. This foundation was afterwards augnnented by Wm de
Horwode (Coepe1‘, Memls„ 111, p. 263). The latter was a benefactor
to Corpus Christi College and there was soine connexion between
that college and a chantry at S. Clelnent’s (see BIasters, IIistory os
C. C. 0., pp. 12, 24 and App). When S. Catherine’s Hall was
founded in 1473 by XVoodlark, he purchased property which belonged
to a chantry of ss. ills-try «mal Nielwlas in this church (Willis and
Clark, 11, pp. 71 f.) and this looks as if the cantaria ᾗ fllarz'e here
mentioned was perhaps sei-ved by one of Lolworth's two chaplains.
In 1402 the nuns of S. Radegund gave the vicar of S. Cheinent's a
messii-age for the chantry of S. Mary (Gray‚ op. cit„ p. 28) and
another of their (leeds also mentions this chantry (p. 124). [Dr Stokes
is my informant]

(b) Wm Foster, not given in the list of officials in Hert’s
supplement to Benthani's Elgs p. 34, but that list. is meagre.

(c) John Asselegq. A knight of this name is mentioned in 1460
((7ηηῦ3 Finem, p. 155) who was possibly this lnan's son or relative.

(d) cantaria sce Mario. See note (a) above.

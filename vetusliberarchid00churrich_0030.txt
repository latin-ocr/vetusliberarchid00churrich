to beneficesl and chapelries'2‚ a fruitful source 01 sees (203. 4d.
in the table on p. 163, 61. p. 164), and even the installation of
the heads of certain religious houses, the Abbot 01 Τ1101116)] and
the Priors of Anglesey and Barnwell, each of whom paid 333
(p. 24), and the lesser foundations of Swavesey and Linton
(p. 184), the rest being reserved to the Bishop. Also he saw
to the inspection of letters testimonial of clerics coming from
elsewhere (pp. 66, 108, 130 and Excursus G, p. 304) and granted
such as were required (pp. 172, 178). He further licensed 601-
1661015 01 funds for religious purpose& eg. for the hospital of
Acon (p. 8) or a pardoner (p. 177). Such persons took money
0111 01 1116 diocese and 116 probably did 1101 favour them much, any
more than he did the F riars (see the verses p. 16), but charged
1116111 16653. Τ11611 as oculus episcopi he had general supervision
of 1116 clergy. This was exercised partly by visitations which
were 1101 10 116 made more than once a year, lest they should be
burdensome, nor less than 01166 111 111166 years, lest abuses should
be uncorrected 3 partly by summoning the clergy to synods twice
a year on the Monday after St Luke and the Monday after
Trinity Sunday. At 111656 they shewed their testimonials and
took an oath of obedience to the Arehdeacon‚ also they heard
read the Statutes promulgated by the Bishop of the Diocese
(p. 9) and other Constitutions (p. 7). Moreover the Archdeacon
held a court in which the clergy could be tried for transgressing
such legislation7 and 115 administration was largely in his
hands. For this work he had 11)] him a copy of Peckham De
Concubzmrz‘is (p. 7) and other such. He was accordingly par-
ticularly interested in the general visitation made by Archbishop
Kilwardby⁴ and preserved a copy 01 1116 161161 announcing it,
the points to be inquired into and the visitant’s itinerary

“ut nemini sine licentia 61 mandato episcopi curam praesumas committere
animarum.'' Decret. 1, tit. xxiii, c. 4, quoted by Canon VVood.

³ Novus Liber, p. 52, eg. Calais, Bedlam, Burton Lazars, etc.

⁴ Kilwardby was great at visitations, he came on 1ο 115 from Lincoln‚

having previously done Woroester and Winchester. The Canons of Oseney
grumbled at his high procurations, ν. I).N.B.

said work which he had begun and keep it up in perpetuity. This
is probably the S. aisle of the church, the arcading into which is of
the Decorated period, though the capitals of the pillars are cai-ved
laterl.

Again at Melbourne (p. 115) there is a memorandum that
Ds George the vicar (about the same time) made celaturam, fenestras
et alia iu cancello, under a very similar protest.

Some of the churches are reported to be in a bad state of
repair. For instance, the four ncighbouring churches of Whittles-
ford, Sawstffln Little Abington and Linton (at the end of the
xiiith century) were unsatisfactory in this respect. In the first
two it is noted fenestre vitree (ψ in cwneello at Whittlesford)

Whittlesford other signs of neglect are given3 calist· claudicat.

The churchyard and its walls (as many of us know to our cost)
have always been a burden on the incumbents 61· the parish. Hence
at Little Abington (p. 65) again we find the entry cimeterium ¹male
clausam, while at Littleport (p. 141) there is a memorandum that
Stephen the vicar on the &Vednesday after the feast of All Saints' in
1309 made protest at Archdeacon F odringhey's visitation that he
refused to bind himself or his successore propter fitctwrctm unius

Other protests of the clergy may be recorded here, though they
refer to other matters than the actual fabric of the church 61· yard:
viz. at Harston (p. 93), at Ehn and Elnneth (p. 117), at Gt Eversden
(p. 123), and Bournc (p. 1:27).

At Harston (p. 93) however we read a more cheerful entry under
this head, viz. that Adam Prat gave mxli ιῘὶώνίσθ ecclesie.

be found in A. Hamilton Thompson, Ground Plan of Eny. Par. Ch„ pp. 70 ff.

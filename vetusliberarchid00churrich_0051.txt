HANDS IN MS. xxxv

Emneth (B¹), Whittlesey St Andrew (B¹)‚ Benwick and
March (B2).
To the B class belong most of the notes about 311111111011363.
C, c. 1304 C hands 316 those connected with R. de Fodringhey's activities
⁴3¹⁶· (1304—1316).
01 is in character not unlike 3 Β hand, but is dated 1304 at
Tydd, p. 108, and 1305 at 1Ven(ly‚ p. 101. Other occurrences
316 Stmv-cum-Quy, Duxford St John (Walter the Rector is
given 33 6. 1304) and St Peter, 31161 Cottenham. An entry
31 Cambridge St John, p. 56, is also dated 1304, but
seems in 3 different hand, which occurs nowhere else.
(3³ runs right through the Inventories‚ and bears dates from 1304
to 1311. It therefore does not necessarily begin later than
(1¹, though it goes on so much longer. The examples
of it on the facsimile are not very typical, 31161 the hand
⁸varies 3 good deal. Fodringhey’s denunciation of those
who interfere with the testamentary dispositions of serfs
(MS. p. 42, inf. p. 17) seems to have 3 resemblance to (1¹2.
D, c. 1316 Β1 111113 right through the Inventories‚ and always succeeds
‘134⁰' to 023 it 1133 311 elaborate 31161 3 63161633 101111, but these
may really be two 11311613. Τ116 mention of Thomas de
Abinton (Abinton parva, p. 65) 33 Vicar of St Botolph's‚
Cambridge, shews that it went on after 1320.
D² made 3 good many entries: it succeeds immediately to
D1. It is the most ambitious hand in the book, though
very uneven (see plaste), but it can be recognised by 3
curious yellow ink 31161 the spelling spalterz‘wn. It rather
1663113 the hand in which Advocates' names are entered in
1306 (p. 43), but the dates hardly allow osan identification.
The entry mentioning T. de Pateshull at Grantchester
(1324—1331), p. 95, 13 1113616 111 3 1131161 that does not recur.
The date 1338 at Swaffham Prior St Cyriac has been
bungled in such 3 way 33 to suggest that it was written
well after 1350.
